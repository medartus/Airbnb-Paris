    should create 2 new periods around the new free period
- Reserving the end of an free period:

https://puu.sh/GVspG/7d5649e844.png

potentially unwanted result --> first date handling, creates a buffer that forces 
a 1 day period, this works with the format, however the periods seem weird.
This is a rare edge case, with no simple fix due to the way we handle the
general case.
It might be interesting to add a way to detect left extensions in the general
case as we do with the right ext.
